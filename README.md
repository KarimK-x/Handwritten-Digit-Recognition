# Overview
- Successfully built and utilized a neural network to do multiclass classification using Softmax Regression.
- Plotted multiple graphs displaying each step in the process of building the model.
- Optimized NN using Adam optimizer and applied softmax activation function.(Done by linear activation in output layer and tuning loss function to avoid numerical roundoff errors)
- After optimization, resulted in an error percentage of _**0.04%**_ !
## Background 
- My first machine learning project implemented just after finishing the renowned Andrew Ng's Machine Learning specialization
- Libraries Used:
  - Tensorflow
  - Keras
  - Numpy
  - Matplotlib.pyplot
## Project Structure
Very simply two files:
  - **mainNotebook:** Jupyter notebook implementing the nn as well as displaying different functions using matplotlib.pyplot
  - **main.py:** python file containing functions used in the notebook
  - **data:** contains dataset in a .npy file
